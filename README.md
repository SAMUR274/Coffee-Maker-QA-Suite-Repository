# Coffee Maker QA Suite Repository

This project is a comprehensive quality assurance (QA) suite for testing the functionality of a Coffee Maker application. The suite is designed to ensure the reliability, correctness, and robustness of various components of the Coffee Maker system, including inventory management, recipe handling, and user interactions.

---

## Overview

The Coffee Maker QA Suite was developed to validate the key functionalities of a Coffee Maker application, leveraging **JUnit** and **Mockito** for unit and integration testing. The project aims to simulate real-world scenarios and identify potential edge cases to maintain high software quality standards.

---

## Features

- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test cases for inventory management, recipe addition, deletion, and coffee preparation.
- **Mocking with Mockito**: Simulation of interactions with dependent classes, such as `RecipeBook` and `Inventory`.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Tests for malformed inputs, negative inventory values, and invalid recipe configurations.
- **Code Coverage**: Ensures high code coverage by testing all critical paths and edge cases.

---

## Key Functionalities Tested

1. **Inventory Management**:
   - Validates inventory updates with valid and invalid inputs.
   - Ensures accurate inventory consumption during coffee preparation.

2. **Recipe Handling**:
   - Adds and deletes recipes, ensuring the system respects capacity constraints.
   - Handles duplicate and invalid recipe submissions.

3. **Coffee Preparation**:
   - Tests coffee preparation with sufficient and insufficient inventory.
   - Validates correct change calculation for coffee purchases.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Testing Frameworks**: JUnit, Mockito
- **Version Control**: Git
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse
- **Build Tools**: Maven

---

## Example Test Scenarios

- **Successful Coffee Preparation**:
  - **Input**: Valid recipe and sufficient inventory.
  - **Output**: Coffee prepared successfully with correct change returned.

- **Inventory Exception**:
  - **Input**: Negative inventory values.
  - **Output**: `InventoryException` raised.

- **Recipe Management**:
  - **Input**: Adding a duplicate recipe.
  - **Output**: Recipe rejected with appropriate error handling.

## Areas of Improvement & Pending Tasks

While the project successfully covers core functionalities, the following areas can be further developed to enhance the QA suite:

1. **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines**:
   - Automate test execution on every commit using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.

2. **Enhanced Code Coverage**:
   - Add tests for edge cases involving multi-threaded operations.
   - Include UI-level tests to validate end-to-end user interactions.

3. **Load and Stress Testing**:
   - Simulate high user load scenarios to ensure the application performs under stress.

4. **Test Reporting**:
   - Integrate test reports using tools like **Allure** to provide a detailed overview of test results.

5. **Scalability Tests**:
   - Extend tests to validate performance when handling a large number of recipes and transactions.

6. **Mocking Improvements**:
   - Increase the use of advanced Mockito features, such as argument captors and spies, to ensure better control over test cases.

###Future Improvements
Performance Benchmarking:

Develop benchmarks to evaluate the efficiency of inventory operations under different load conditions.
Advanced Mocking:

Use Mockitoâ€™s advanced features like spies and argument captors to improve test isolation and flexibility.
Edge-Case Coverage:

Create test cases that cover edge scenarios, such as inventory overflows, extreme user inputs, and concurrent operations.
Test Reporting Integration:

Integrate tools like Allure or JaCoCo to generate detailed and interactive test reports.
Load and Stress Testing:

Simulate real-world conditions by testing the system under high transactional loads.
UI/End-to-End Testing:

Include tests that validate user interaction flows to ensure a seamless experience.
